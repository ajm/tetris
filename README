# ISSUES
pre-experiment text/questions missing
post-experiment text/questions missing

experiment timeout is a variable called "gameDuration" in static/tetris.js
maximum game speed is a variable called "maxSpeed" in static/tetris.js
    - this is confusing because 1 is the fastest and maxSpeed is the slowest(!)

do people do one experiment or several?
    - add participant ID to pre-experiment questions?
